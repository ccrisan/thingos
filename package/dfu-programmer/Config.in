	  Dfu-programmer is a multi-platform command-line programmer
	  for Atmel (8051, AVR, XMEGA & AVR32) chips with a USB
	  bootloader supporting ISP. Most Atmel devices having a USB
	  port come pre-programmed with the bootloader, and this is a
	  lightweight alternative to Atmel's own FLIP/BatchISP program.
