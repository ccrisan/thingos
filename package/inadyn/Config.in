	  In-a-Dyn is Dynamic DNS (DDNS) client with HTTPS support used
	  to automate the task of keeping your Internet name in sync
	  with your public (DHCP/PPPoE) IP address.  It can also be used
	  when you have backup connections to the Internet.

	  For HTTPS support you need to select one of the libraries:
	  OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or mbed TLS (PolarSSL).
