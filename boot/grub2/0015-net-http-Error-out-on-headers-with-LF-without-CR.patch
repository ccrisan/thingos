Subject: [PATCH] net/http: Error out on headers with LF without CR

In a similar vein to the previous patch, parse_line() would write
a NUL byte past the end of the buffer if there was an HTTP header
with a LF rather than a CRLF.

RFC-2616 says:

  Many HTTP/1.1 header field values consist of words separated by LWS
  or special characters. These special characters MUST be in a quoted
  string to be used within a parameter value (as defined in section 3.6).

We don't support quoted sections or continuation lines, etc.

If we see an LF that's not part of a CRLF, bail out.

Fixes: CVE-2022-28734
